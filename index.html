            <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
            <adress> By: Taylor Foster 1/18/2015</adress>
            <p> Hello and welcome! This blog will be my way to share with the world the major turing point in my life and the start of a new career. About two weeks ago, I started a program called <a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a> in which they produce junior level developers in a span of 3 very demanding months. These past two weeks has been a roller coaster of emotions. One minute your jumping for joy because you figured out something you've been working on for hours, and the next minute you banging your head against the desk saying "WHY ISNT THIS WORKING?!" It all comes with great reward though. Accomplishing a task that our instructor has given and truly feeling like you nailed it is a great feeling. I have no background in computer science nor have I ever really worked with a Mac very much.<span class="quote">"I absolutely love what I do and learning has never been this fun"</span>  My background before The Iron yard was just working in the resturaunt business ever since I had graduated highschool, with no real direction. Now two weeks in, I can build basic web page layouts using HTML, add styling using CSS and also navigate my way around my Mac using the command line. I absolutely love what I do and learning has never been this fun. I owe a big part of that to my inscructor David Rogers who's teaching style is unlike any I have ever seen. He gives you the tools you need to answer your own questions. He forces you to think like a developer and research your questions instead of directly asking him. On a side note, no matter how hard you try he wont give you answer because "The googles knows that." The Iron Yard preaches companionship and unity and everyone in our cohort has adapted this concept. We all bounce ideas off each other and each one of us has something to offer. I am more than thrilled to be a part of this academy and look forward to further documenting my experience with you!</p>
